This project aims to extract information for clinical variants in the ABraOM database.

In this project we analyzed which variant annotations of the five Primary Familial Brain Calcification genes are present in the  SABE609 South-American cohort. The genes are SLC20A2, XPR1, PDGFB, PDGFRB, KIAA1161 and JAM2.

For this, we have used pandas to access the ABRaOM_60+_SABE_609_exomes_annotated.csv file downloaded from ABraOM (http://abraom.ib.usp.br/), and compared the variants to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) database.
